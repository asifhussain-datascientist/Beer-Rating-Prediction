# Beer Rating Prediction

This project aims to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict the overall rating of beers based on various factors, including beer name, style, user reviews, and other relevant information.

**Objectives:**

* **Build and evaluate a robust machine learning model** for predicting beer ratings.
* **Explore and implement effective feature engineering techniques** to improve model performance.
* **Compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms** (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Regression) on the given dataset.
* **Conduct thorough data analysis and visualization** to gain insights into the factors influencing beer ratings.
* **Document the entire process** clearly and concisely in this README file.

**Dataset:**

* The dataset used in this project is "train.csv," which contains information about beers, user reviews, and user demographics.

**Data Preprocessing:**

1. **Data Loading:** Loaded the dataset using pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning:** 
    * Handled missing values (e.g., filled numerical columns with the mean).
    * Checked and removed duplicate rows.
3. **Feature Engineering:**
    * Extracted features from text data (beer/name, beer/style, review/text) using:
        * **BERT:** Obtained vector representations of text using a pre-trained BERT model.
    * **One-Hot Encoding:** Encoded categorical features like "beer/style".
4. **Data Splitting:** Split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).

**Model Selection and Training:**

* **Models:**
    * Random Forest Regressor
    * Support Vector Regressor
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilized GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for each model.
* **Model Training:** Trained the models on the training data.

**Model Evaluation:**

* Evaluated the trained models on the test set using the following metrics:
    * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    * R-squared
    * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)


**Further Improvements:**

* Explore more advanced text processing techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling).
* Experiment with other machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks).
* Conduct more in-depth feature engineering and selection.
* Improve data visualization to gain deeper insights into the data.

**Note:**

This README file provides a concise overview of the project and its objectives. You should update it with the specific details of your project, including:

* The actual data cleaning and preprocessing steps you performed.
* The specific hyperparameters you tuned.
* The actual performance metrics of your models.
* Any additional insights or observations you gained during the analysis.

I hope this enhanced README file effectively communicates the objectives and findings of your project!
